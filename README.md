### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a simple website for an ATV rental business, there is no fancy logic as all the bookings are handled by phone calls or whatsapp. This website is primary meant for mobile. Users can see all the infomation they need to make a booking decision and then contact the business directly. The website will hold information such as location, contact information, and available vehicles, eligibility requirements, and safety guidelines. Pricing is to be excluded from being displayed on the website to encourage potential customers to reach out directly for a personalized quote.
